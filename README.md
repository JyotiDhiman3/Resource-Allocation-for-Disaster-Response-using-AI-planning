# Resource-Allocation-for-Disaster-Response-using-AI-planning

Disaster response and resource allocation during natural or man-made disasters are critical but highly challenging tasks.
The problem at hand is the allocation of resources in humanitarian logistics. It deals majorly with allocating resources

from resource centers (single or multiple), and decisions are made about how to distribute resources to minimize costs 
while considering factors like accessibility, deprivation, and penalties.
